          <p style="font-size: medium;"> Thank you for visiting my online web portfolio!<br>Hi there, my name is Natalia Canary, I am a Zimbabwean student 
              that has moved across the ocean to study at Curtin Mauritius.
              I am in my final semester with Web and Mobile Applications as my last module to complete. <br>
              I am delighted to share with you about myself, experiences, and skills.
              I have a few years of work experience working in a range of industries, and I want to apply the knowledge that I have gained 
              from them to improve both my personal development and my web development skills. <br> I have acquired a wide range of skills and 
              knowledge during my academic career and professional career, enabling me to grow in my work and add value to both my employers and my studies.<br>

              passionate about and what I am not. Being an International student has had been intersting but it has been a great experience indiscovering new places and meeting new
              people. I have seen the growth in terms of being an introvert and my confidence gained through my univeristy journey as well as through the workplace.</p>

          <p>Despite encountering a few minor challenges during development, the website has largely functioned as intended. I thoroughly enjoyed 
            the process of creating it, as it helped me comprehend each concept covered in the module, and everything began to make more sense as 
            it came together. Initially, I believed that building the website's framework first and adding the design and style later was the best 
            strategy. Since I already had an idea of how I wanted it to look, constructing the framework was relatively simple. After adding the 
            necessary components, I proceeded to add the navigation bar and then the content. Although it took some time to structure the content, 
            I eventually succeeded, especially in the About section, where I wanted to highlight my personal characteristics while maintaining a 
            professional tone and ensuring that I covered the essentials.<br>

            The few difficulties I encountered mainly involved aligning, styling, and adhering to the style guide. I had to do some research on 
            W3schools to figure out what I could do and how to make it work to solve the issues. Having worked on the online shop during my internship 
            at Emcar Ltd, I found it much easier to create the web portfolio, but the content to add was extensive. Working on the back end made it 
            much clearer how everything worked, and I was able to thoroughly review each error and make sense of it. I also tested each section to 
            ensure it functioned as intended.<br>
            
            I realized that it took longer than I anticipated to create the portfolio since it involved many aspects, and I need to improve my time 
            management skills. I found myself rushing to cover all parts of the portfolio and the lessons learned in the module, and time went by 
            quickly. It also took me a while to figure out how to use Github and add all the projects while ensuring that everything worked and I 
            had the correct files.
